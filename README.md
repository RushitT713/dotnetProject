House of Chance - Casino FunPlay is a comprehensive web-based casino gaming platform developed using ASP.NET Core MVC framework with real-time multiplayer capabilities. The application features three classic casino games: Texas Hold'em Poker, European Roulette, and Blackjack, all integrated with a robust virtual wallet system for seamless gameplay experience.

The platform leverages modern web technologies including SignalR for real-time communication, Entity Framework Core for data persistence, and SQLite as the database engine. Players can create or join game lobbies, manage their virtual currency, track transaction history, and compete with other players in real-time multiplayer environments.

Key features include cookie-based player identification, persistent wallet management, live leaderboards, transaction history tracking, and an intuitive user interface designed with responsive CSS and dynamic JavaScript interactions. The application implements server-authoritative game logic to ensure fair gameplay and prevent client-side manipulation.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of full-stack web development concepts, real-time web technologies, database design, middleware architecture, and modern UI/UX principles in the context of an interactive gaming platform.
